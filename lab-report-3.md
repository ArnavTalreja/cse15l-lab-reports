# RESEARCHING COMMANDS
In this lab report, I will be exploring command-line options for the `find` command. I will be using a cloned copy of the skill-demo1-data repository to demonstrate the commands.
### SEARCHING FOR FILES BY TYPE:-
The `-type` modifier of the `find` command allows us to search for files within a directory by the type of file.\
For example, `find * -type d` command prints all the individual directories within the repository.
