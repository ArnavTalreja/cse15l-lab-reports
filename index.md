**# Installing VS Code**
We'll start of by downloading and installing a source code editor. There are a lot of source code editors out there but for this tutorial, we'll be using VS Code.
You can downlaod VS code from the following link:-
[https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
